TO INSTALL: drop the .DDS files into "Falcon BMS 4.36\Data\TerrData\Objects\KoreaObj" or your appropriate theatre Objects directory, and overwrite the default textures there.
If you don't want to overwrite already existing vanilla textures, you can put it in the adjacent "_HiRes" directory, but then you NEED to ensure you have HiRes textures enabled.
